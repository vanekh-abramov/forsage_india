The riveter has a movable handle that serves as a power lever and a fixed handle that provides support. It is also equipped with a wire loop that holds the handles together, which is convenient for storage. The principle of its operation is as follows: the force applied by the user to the handle of the tool is transmitted to the working mechanism, which installs the rivet element in the hole. The tool is used mainly for construction purposes in everyday life, in production and in repair shops. For service stations, garages and homes."

It consists of gripping paws and a metal rod. The gripping distance can be easily changed due to the movable joint. The most effective way to dismantle rolling bearings is to use a mechanical puller. A mechanical puller ensures that there is no damage to either the bearings or the surfaces adjacent to them during dismantling, since damage to the bearings entails its complete replacement. This tool is used in auto repair shops, service stations, and by car owners for preventive and repair work on car maintenance. When replacing bearings, pullers are an indispensable device that makes it possible to compress and safely dismantle the bearing. The tool is made of high-quality steel. Due to this, the puller is able to withstand increased loads."
